# Web-Calculator
A simple Web Calculator with HTML5, JavaScript and a Little jQuery
You'll need a little data connection to load the jQuery Library. The work here is to help scroll the text are a as calculations occur.
I placed everything on a single page for simplicity
I'll appreciate your reviews. Anyways, updates are coming soon
Thanks
